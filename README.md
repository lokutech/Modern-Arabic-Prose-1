Vincente Cantarino's "Syntax of Modern Arabic Prose The Simple Sentence" rewritten

ISBN-13: 978-0253395047

Current issues:

Some words either have a mistake, or missing tashkeel, or need to be verified that are correct are highlighted in yellow.
Sentences end with 'أن' and missing tashkeel are highlighed in blue. They
Page is missing. I will be happy to add it if someone has access to the print and can send a phone of the missing page.
